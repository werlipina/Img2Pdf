# Img2Pdf
A quick Python Script to convert Images to PDF.

### What it does?

1. Checks if "Images" and "PDF" folder exist; create them if not present to make life easier, it will also return a print upon creation.

2. Checks if there is JPG or PNG files inside "Images" folder (Source Folder); to avoid any complex errors, it will also let you know if there's no images there. You can add more extensions by editing the code.

3. Generates a PDF file with an unique filename based on date, time, sec, name from the Source Folder and a default prefix "_PDF_";    
Why I did this? For the sake of organization and also it helps to search/remember later when working with multiple PDFs. So, you can create multiple PDF files instead of replacing the already created one.

4. Lastly, it's very faster and RAM friendly!
